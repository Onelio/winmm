## WinMM
CGO bindings for the core winmm.lib Api to record and play audio on Windows.

âš  *This project does not include all of the API calls but is capable of recording and playing audio in an easy way.*

### Usage
You can find a ready to run example of how to use the package in the example folder. If you need more help on a certain function you can refer to: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/

I do not include documentation of how to use it since it's all already documented in the official webpage.
